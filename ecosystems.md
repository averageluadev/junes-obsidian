# **human impact on the environment**

the needs of the human population sometimes conflict with the conservation if the environment, eg: a rising population means we need more food however , farmland disrupts natural habitats and reduces biodiversity

it is important to balance the need for resources with the need to preserve the biodiversity of ecosystems. This is essential to protect ecosystems and endangered species, whilst still
maintaining quality of life for humans.
 **intensive farming**
 Intensive farming is an agricultural system characterised by the use of machinery, chemicals (fertilisers, pesticides etc.) and battery methods to maximise space and produce high crop yields. It has both advantages and disadvantages:

**[[eutrophication]]**
Excess fertiliser or untreated sewage may wash into water sources causing eutrophication:
1. Fertiliser or sewage enters rivers and lakes.
2. Nutrient build-up in water.
3. Algal bloom blocks sunlight.
4. Aquatic plants cannot photosynthesise less oxygen produced.
5. They die and decompose.
6. Decomposers further deplete oxygen levels.
7. Animals can no longer respire aerobically so die.

**detecting pollution**
Water pollution can be detected by the use of electronic meters which measure changes in pH or oxygen levels.

an indicator species is a species whose peresense or absence in an environment provides
indication of environmental conditions e.g. pollution levels.

Lichens are a type of indicator species that can be used to measure air pollution. 
Different types of lichen grow in different levels of air pollution e.g. bushy lichens grow in cleaner air than crusty lichens. 
The abundance and distribution of lichens indicate levels of pollution.
However, indicator species are less accurate than non-living indicators and do not provide a
definitive figure for pollution levels.

**pollution**

Some chemicals that do not break down rapidly (e.g. heavy metals) can enter food chains and accumulate in organisms. At higher trophic levels they become very concentrated and may become toxic to larger animals such as whales.

**food chains and food webs**

Sunlight is the source of all energy in biological systems. It is absorbed by photosynthetic
organisms (producers) and converted to chemical energy (biomass) during photosynthesis. 

This biomass is transferred between organisms during feeding (and is used for growth, repair, etc.) before eventually returning to the soil when decomposers break down dead material and waste	

### **trophic levels**

A food chain describes the feeding relationships between organisms and the resultant stages of energy and biomass transfer. Each stage is known as a trophic level. A simple food chain is shown below (the arrows represent the direction of energy transfer):
producer → primary consumer → secondary consumer → tertiary consumer
Producers are always the first trophic level because:
● They provide all energy for the food chain via photosynthesis
● The rest of the food chain involves the transfer of this energy

Primary consumers are normally herbivores whilst secondary and tertiary consumers are
carnivores. Decomposers can obtain energy from dead organisms at any point in a food chain.

Food webs show how different food chains are interlinked and how members of an ecosystem are interdependent.

**energy loss**

Energy transfer is inefficient. At each stage of a food chain energy is lost for a variety of reasons:
 ● 90% of the sun's energy is reflected
 ● Respiration to generate heat energy, energy for movement etc. in animals
 ● Some parts of organisms are indigestible
 ● Egestion, excretion

#### There are rarely more than four or five trophic levels in a food chain; above this, there is insufficient energy to support another breeding population to calculate the efficiency of energy transfer:
$$
efficiency = \frac {biomass.available.after .transfer}{biomass .avalible .after. transfer} X 100
$$

The less efficient the energy transfers, the fewer the trophic levels and the fewer the
number of organisms at each trophic level

**pyramids of numbers and biomass**

Feeding relationships can be illustrated as pyramids. A pyramid of numbers represents the number of organisms per unit area at each trophic level. A pyramid of biomass shows the dry mass of living material per unit area at each trophic level.

Pyramids of biomass generally take a ‘true pyramid’ form (as energy is lost at each trophic level).
In comparison, pyramids of numbers are often not pyramid shaped as they don’t take size and mass of organisms into account

**microorganisms**

Decomposition is the breakdown of dead materials into simpler organic matter.

Decomposers (e.g. bacteria, fungi) are important in the recycling of organic matter, that is returning vital nutrients to the soil. They release enzymes which catalyse the breakdown of dead material into smaller molecules such as nitrates, phosphates etc. This ensures a balance in ecosystems: the processes that remove materials from the soil are balanced by the processes that return them.
