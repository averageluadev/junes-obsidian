 **The need for a respiratory system**
Unlike smaller organisms, large multicellular organisms require a respiratory system because:
● Small Surface Area/Volume ratio
● Diffusion insufficient to provide all cells with the required O2 and to remove all CO2

# ***Structure of the respiratory system***


Pathway of gas through the respiratory system:
nose → trachea → bronchi → bronchioles → alveoli → capillaries
![[Pasted image 20240402081713.png]]
Cells lining the surface of the respiratory tract produce mucus. This is sticky and traps harmful substances and organisms, preventing entry into the lungs. Ciliated epithelial cells found lining the respiratory tract move in a synchronised wave to beat mucus up to the back of the throat where it is swallowed. This protects the lungs from infection.

**ventilation**
ventilation is the movement of fresh air into the lungs and stale air out of the lungs via inspiration (breathing in) and expiration (breathing out). The processes of inspiration and expiration are outlined in the table below:

| inspiration                                | expiration                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| ribs move up and out                       | ribs move down and in                       |
| diaphragm contracts and flattens           | diaphragm relaxes and reverts to dome shape |
| volume of thorax increases                 | volume of thorax decreases                  |
| Thoracic pressure falls below air pressure | thoracic pressure rises above air pressure  |
| air moves into trachea                     | air moves out of trachea                    |
A bell jar model can be used as a model of ventilation.
![[Pasted image 20240402082445.png]]
As the rubber sheet is drawn down during inspiration, the volume of the bell jar increases and its pressure falls below air pressure. Air moves into the glass tube and balloons causing inflation.

**Limitations of the bell jar model**


| thorax                                     | bell jar model               |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| thoracic cavity filled with pleural fluid  | bell jar filled with air     |
| Cartilage in trachea flexible              | Glass tube rigid             |
| Diaphragm flattens                         | Rubber sheet drawn downwards |
| Lungs composed of many alveoli             | balloons empty               |
| Ribs move to change thoracic cavity volume | Bell jar does not move       |
**alveoli**
The alveoli are a cluster of air sacs found in the lungs where gas exchange occurs:
● O2 diffuses from air in the alveoli into blood in the capillaries
● CO2 diffuses from blood in the capillaries into air in the alveoli
![[Pasted image 20240402083137.png]]
Alveoli are adapted for gas exchange:
● Large surface area
● Surrounded by a network of capillaries giving a good blood supply
● Rapid blood flow maintains a steep concentration gradient
● Thin wall gives a short diffusion distance
● Walls covered by thin, moist film, allowing gases to dissolve and increasing diffusion rate
**Composition of inspired and expired air**

| gas            | %inspired air | % expired air |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| oxygen         | 21            | 16            |
| carbon dioxide | 0.04          | 4             |
| nitrogen       | 79            | 79            |
| water vapour   | variable      | 1             |
To test for the presence of CO2, bubble gas through lime water. CO2 turns lime water milky.


**The effects of smoking on the respiratory system**
Several chemicals found in tobacco smoke cause damage to the respiratory system. The effects of
each are described in the table below:

| chemical        | effect                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| carcinogens     | Chemicals that increase the risk of cancer, e.g. lung, oesophagus, mouth                                                                                                                                          |
| tar             | sticky substance deposited in the airways. Stimulates mucus production.<br>Paralyses the cilia, preventing mucus from being swept away. Mucus<br>contains microorganisms and dirt builds. Leads to smoker’s cough |
| nicotine        | Addictive. Increases heart rate. Directly damages lungs.                                                                                                                                                          |
| carbon monoxide | Binds with haemoglobin in red blood cells irreversibly, reducing the<br>oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.                                                                                                    |

Damage to the alveoli walls and loss of elasticity in the alveoli can lead to emphysema, a lung condition resulting in breathing difficulties

# **circulatory system**

The circulatory system is a network of organs and vessels which enables the flow of blood and transport of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients and other molecules around the body.

 **blood**
Blood is a body fluid which serves as a transport medium for nutrients and molecules around the body. It has four main components:


| component         | function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| red blood cells   | Transport oxygen from the lungs to tissues:<br>  ● At the lungs haemoglobin in RBCs binds reversibly with oxygen to<br>       form oxyhaemoglobin<br>   ● At the tissues oxyhaemoglobin breaks down to form haemoglobin     and oxygen which diffuses into cells Transport carbon dioxide from tissues to the lungs |
| white blood cells | Provide immunological protection:<br>● Phagocytes engulf and destroy pathogens<br>● Lymphocytes produce antibodies                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| plasma            | Pale-yellow liquid portion of the blood that transports proteins, nutrients,<br>waste products, hormones, antibodies, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| platelets         | plays role in blood clotting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
Red blood cells are adapted to their function:
● Biconcave disk gives a large surface-area-to-volume ratio, increasing diffusion rate.
● Small and flexible so they can squeeze through capillaries.
● No nucleus more space for haemoglobin molecules, increasing oxygen-carrying capacity
of the cell. Phagocytes (type of white blood cell) are adapted to their function:
● Can change shape to engulf foreign material.
● Flexible membrane  can squeeze through pores in capillary walls and enter tissue fluid.
● Contain enzymes that digest pathogens.


**Double circulatory system**

Mammals have a double circulatory system where blood flows through the heart in two circuits: pulmonary circuit and systemic circuit.

| pulmonary system                                                | systemic circuit                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| involves the right of the heart                                 | involves the left of the heart                                     |
| deoxygenated blood transported to lungs                         | oxygenated blood transported to tissues and organs around the body |
| gaseous exchange occurs between the alveoli and the capillaries | exchange of materials occurs at tissues                            |
| oxygenated blood returns to the left side of the heart          | deoxygenated blood returns to the left of the heart                |

**Structure of the heart**

The mammalian heart is a muscular pump that pushes blood around the body. It consists of four chambers (left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium and right ventricle) and associated blood vessels. The left and right sides of the heart are separated by a muscular wall, the septum.


![[Pasted image 20240403132850.png]]

The coronary artery supplies heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients.

Blood flow: Pulmonary vein → Left atrium → Left ventricle → Aorta → Body
→ Vena cava → Right atrium → Right ventricle → Pulmonary artery → Lungs


The wall of the left ventricle is thicker than that of the right ventricle, as it must pump blood a further
distance at a higher pressure. The walls of the ventricles are thicker than the atrial walls.
Valves prevent backflow of blood. They ensure that blood flow occurs in one direction only:


| valve     | location                                 | function                                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bicuspid  | between left atrium and left ventricle   | stops backflow from ventricle                                                             |
| tricuspid | between right atrium and right ventricle | into the atria                                                                            |
| semilunar | vetween ventricles and arteries          | Ensure that after leaving<br>the heart, blood is not<br>drawn back into the<br>ventricles |

**blood vessels**
here are three types of blood vessel in the body: arteries, veins and capillaries.
	 ● Arteries carry blood away from the heart under high pressure
	 ● Veins carry blood towards the heart under low pressure
	 ● Capillaries enable the exchange of materials at tissues
Normally, deoxygenated blood travels in veins towards the heart and oxygenated blood travels in arteries away from the heart. The only exceptions to this are the pulmonary artery, which carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs, and the pulmonary vein which carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. Each blood vessel is adapted to its function:

| vessel    | structure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| artery    | ● Narrow lumen maintains high pressure<br>● Thick wall to withstand high pressure<br>● Thick layer of smooth muscle provides strength<br>● Thick layer of elastic fibres allow stretch and recoil<br>● Smooth inner lining to reduce friction<br>● No valves |
| vein      | ● Large lumen eases blood flow<br>● Thin wall allows muscles to easily compress the vein aiding blood flow<br>● Thin layer of smooth muscle and elastic fibres<br>● Valves prevent backflow of blood                                                         |
| capiliary | ● Form large network  greater surface area for diffusion<br>● Walls one cell thick giving a short diffusion distance<br>● Walls permeable allowing the exchange of substances<br>● Narrow lumen decreases diffusion distance                                 |


**cardiovascular disease**
Cardiovascular disease is a group of diseases affecting the heart or blood vessels.
A build up of fatty deposits on the walls of the arteries forms atheromas which reduce blood flow to muscle tissue. Blood clots may form, blocking the arteries and stopping blood flow completely. This can lead to a heart attack or stroke

**risks for CVD**
A risk factor is a variable associated with a greater chance of developing a disease or infection. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease include:
 ● High blood pressure - damages blood vessel walls and promotes the deposition of fatty
 substances, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis
 ● High blood cholesterol - cholesterol deposited on the walls of blood vessels increasing the risk of atherosclerosis
 ● Smoking - carbon monoxide reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood  heart   must work harder to deliver the required volume of oxygen to tissues
 ● Obesity - fat builds up around the heart muscle heart must work harder to pump blood
 around the body
 ● Lack of exercise - exercise improves the efficiency of the heart and reduces obesity
 ● Family history of heart disease - genetic predisposition
 ● Poor Diet - high in fat and salt
 
 **treating CVD**
 
 There are three methods of treating cardiovascular disease:
● Improving diet and lifestyle
● Medication
● Angioplasty

| taking statins      | A group of drugs that lower blood- cholesterol levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Convenient - taken orally                               | Side effects - liver<br>damage, kidney failure,<br>memory problems.<br>Do not directly treat CVD<br>but reduce the risk factor<br>of high blood cholesterol.      |
| angioplasty         | A small balloon is used to inflate an artery and a hollow tube (known as a stent) is inserted into the lumen. The stent expands, holding the artery open.                                                                                                                                                          | more permenant                                          | Insertion requires surgery.
